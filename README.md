[RLBot] is a framework for creating offline Rocket League bots. This crate
exposes Rust bindings to RLBot's [RLBot_Core_Interface.dll]. It presents a
simple, safe interface that should feel comfortable to Rust developers.

[RLBot]: https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot
[RLBot_Core_Interface.dll]: https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot/tree/master/src/main/cpp/RLBotInterface

## Usage

```rust
let rlbot = rlbot::init()?;
rlbot.start_match(rlbot::MatchSettings::simple_1v1("Hero", "Villian"))?;

let mut packets = rlbot.packeteer();

// Wait for the match to start. `packets.next()` sleeps until the next
// packet is available, so this loop will not roast your CPU :)
while !packets.next()?.GameInfo.RoundActive {}

loop {
    let packet = packets.next()?;
    let input: rlbot::PlayerInput = Default::default();
    rlbot.update_player_input(input, 0)?;
}
```

### Quick start

This repo comes with a simple example to get you started. It's called `atba`,
which stands for Always Towards Ball Agent. To try it out, open Rocket League,
and then run the example like so:

```sh
git clone https://gitlab.com/whatisaphone/rlbot-rust
cd rlbot
cargo run --example atba
```

If you get an error, chances are you need to download the framework! Proceed to
the next section.

### Installing the framework

RLBot is needed to use this RLBot binding, of course. If the framework is not
found in any of Windows's [DLL search locations], `init()` will return this
error:

[DLL search locations]: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/desktop/dlls/dynamic-link-library-search-order#standard-search-order-for-desktop-applications

```text
Os { code: 2, kind: NotFound, message: "The system cannot find the file specified." }
```

You'll need to download [these files] from RLBot:

[these files]: https://github.com/RLBot/RLBot/tree/master/src/main/python/rlbot/dll

* `RLBot_Injector.exe`
* `RLBot_Core.dll`
* `RLBot_Core_Interface.dll`

Place them in a directory in your `$PATH`. Alternatively, if you don't want to
pollute your system, place them in your crate's target directory, e.g.
`target/debug` or `target/release`).

## Development

### Prerequisites

* Use [rustup] to install both stable Rust and nightly Rust.

  This library targets stable Rust, however nightly Rust is needed for a few
  development niceties like `cargo fmt` and `cargo doc`.

* Install [pre-commit], and run this command:

  ```sh
  pre-commit install
  ```

  This makes it much less likely that your commits will break the build.

[rustup]: https://rustup.rs/
[pre-commit]: https://pre-commit.com/

### How to generate bindings

Bindings are generated with [rust-bindgen]. Those docs are required reading.

[rust-bindgen]: https://rust-lang-nursery.github.io/rust-bindgen/

After bindgen and its prerequisites are installed and working, run this
delightfully short command:

```sh
rlbot=<path-to-rlbot>
bindgen \
    "$rlbot"/src/main/cpp/RLBotInterface/RLBotInterface/Interface.hpp \
    -o src/ffi.rs \
    --disable-name-namespacing \
    --no-layout-tests \
    --default-enum-style rust \
    --with-derive-default \
    --raw-line '#![allow(non_camel_case_types, non_snake_case)]' \
    --whitelist-function Interface::IsInitialized \
    --whitelist-function GameFunctions::SetGameState \
    --whitelist-function GameFunctions::StartMatch \
    --whitelist-function GameFunctions::UpdateFieldInfo \
    --whitelist-function GameFunctions::UpdateLiveDataPacket \
    --whitelist-function GameFunctions::SendQuickChat \
    --whitelist-function GameFunctions::SendChat \
    --whitelist-function GameFunctions::UpdatePlayerInput \
    --whitelist-function RenderFunctions::RenderGroup \
    -- \
    -I "$rlbot"/src/main/cpp/RLBotInterface/RLBotMessages
```

It should output errors in white text. Modify RLBot's source to fix the errors.
For any problematic references to boost, it will be easiest to just purge
indiscriminately. Keep running the above command and fixing errors (fun times!).
After you've subjected yourself to enough pain, it will run successfully and
output more errors, but in red text this time. As long as the errors are in red,
that means it worked!

Now open the resulting file (`src/ffi.rs`) and delete all the `extern "C" pub
fn` declarations at the end. Since the DLL is actually loaded using this
crate's `dll` module, there's no sense exposing the non-working functionsâ€”it
would just lead to confusion.
